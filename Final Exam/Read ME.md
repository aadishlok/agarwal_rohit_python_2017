## 1 Idea
#### Does Weather Affect the Stock Market?

Despite the best efforts of many highly trained economists and market specialists, there is no widespread consensus about how, or even if, weather affects the performance of the stock market.

It seems commonsensical that it must have some impact, since weather is a ubiquitous phenomenon from which traders are never fully isolated. On the other hand, there isn't a clear-cut, logical reason to expect that rain on Wall Street or a hurricane in Mexico should systematically change valuations or trader optimism.

## 2 Data Collection
The dataset I used for training the model is from a Kaggle Facial Expression Recognition Challenge a few years back (FER2013). It comprises a total of __35887 pre-cropped, 48-by-48-pixel grayscale images__ of faces each labeled with one of the 7 emotion classes: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.
