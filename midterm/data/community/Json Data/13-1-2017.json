I wish Mr. Obama had discussed this more often.<br/><br/>Automation and its opportunities and negatives have been around a long time.  I got into this topic in the 80s during the Reagan double-dip recessions.  It was a pretty rough time for the economy and those who were in policy jobs were searching for pathway solutions.  I met with Wassily Leontief, whose name came to my attention through his article in Scientific American on the distribution of incomes and jobs.  It was a well researched article and bottom line he suggested that as automation soaked up traditional jobs, it would be a good idea to cut the work week and free workers for more leisure activities &amp; to pursue personal entrepreneurial activities.  He showed me in his input-output tables that this change, if managed properly, would improve the distribution of incomes &amp; jobs &amp; create more pleasure.<br/><br/>2nd thought: Electricity is fundamental to automation and eventually because of population growth, finite limits to fossil fuels including the challenges of global warming that eventually we will need to build a system of space solar satellites to beam power to Earth grids.  My colleague, Dr, James Powell, has authored a book, \"Silent Earth\", that describes this space solar satellite system that will deliver very cheap electric power to all of the Earth's people to power our needs for a modern standard of living.  The energy efficiency should unleash the economic forces that will increase prosperity.", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "createDate": "1484284227", "updateDate": "1484284266", "approveDate": "1484284266", "userID": 40498339, "userDisplayName": "james jordan", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Falls church, Va", "editorsSelection": 0, "recommendationCount": 7, "replyCount": 2, "assetID": 3464223, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/upshot/in-obamas-farewell-a-warning-on-automations-perils.html", "status": "approved", "commentType": "comment", "replies": {"comments": [{"commentID": 21088813, "status": "approved", "commentSequence": 21088813, "userID": 55986391, "userDisplayName": "Jon", "userLocation": "VA", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "Read Thomas Friedman's, \"Thank You for Being Late\".

In the 1980's, I hosted Cuban dissident Reinaldo Arenas in my Lawrence apartment for 45 minutes, just the two of us chatting one-on-one about being gay here in the US versus there on the island. What he told me was riveting and depressing, even as it was clear he was thrilled to be in a country that was well on the way to ending all legal prosecution and social stigmatism of gays and lesbians.
