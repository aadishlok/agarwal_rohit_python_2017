The relationship of the family members and the staff can highly influence the care received, ranging from mutual respect to constant conflict.<br/><br/>Finally, much of the regulatory framework is not necessarily helpful, and often regulators value paper compliance above actual care delivered, and their intervention may actually divert good caregivers from delivery of care to completion of forms.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the complexity of care given to the frail resident matches the complexity of varied styles of living.  Trying to force the entire care structure into the medical care system, increases cost, increases liability concerns, decreases individual choices, and ultimately separates the resident from their natural social contacts.
