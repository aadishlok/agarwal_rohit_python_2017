In my junior year of college I took an elective Shakespeare course for non-English majors. We studied ten of the most popular plays in ten weeks\u2014my first intensive exposure to the Bard. For years afterward I was instantly able to ID *any* snippet of dialogue from any of these plays\u2014speaker, situation, location in the script\u2014almost instinctively. I always knew that being able to do that wasn't due to any brilliance on my part but was solely a result of the perfection of Shakespeare's poetry, scripting, and construction. More than half a century later, coming up with ACT II was a breeze for me. I'm sure a lot of other solvers had a similar experience.<br/><br/>Also, Deb, a quibble, though with the dictionaries not you. To say that YAW \"means to move back and forth along a flight path\" is faulty in several ways. First, \"back and forth,\" without some indicator of the direction of such movement, could as easily mean backward and forward, instead of side to side, its actual meaning. Second, YAWing is not limited to flight; a boat can also yaw in, and probably under, water. Also, planes landing in a stiff lateral wind may deliberately yaw after touching down to maintain a straight course on the runway.

The crossword clue, as usual, I feel was accurate and fair. Yawing may entail a regular or reciprocal variation around central point, but it doesn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s simply a deviation or movement about the defined vertical axis of an object. This is frequently thought of as \"left or right\" (hence \"side to side\" incorrectly implying ocillation), not usually back and forth.<br/><br/>The yaw axis is perpendicular to the wings on an airplane (or the deck of a boat). The amount of yaw is the amount rotation of the nose of the object around this axis. A boat will yaw into a cross current (also known as \u201ccrabbing\u201d) to maintain a heading. An airplane will crab into the wind to maintain a heading as well. Based on the strength and direction of the wind, the nose of the aircraft will be at some angle off the intended heading while the path over the ground will be - if done correctly - the desired heading. Since wind that happens to be blowing at any given time may not be aligned with runway, aircraft have to crab into the wind on final to stay aligned with the runway centerline; pilots reduce yaw to zero upon touchdown since the friction of the tires resists any yawing force from the wind. If bored sometime, try searching \u201ccross wind landings\u201d on Youtube. Seeing the amount of crab required in high cross wind landings can be exciting.
