Imagine if Hillary had not released her tax returns? Imagine if Hillary had won the electoral college but lost the popular vote? Imagine if Hillary turned over a vast business empire to Chelsea and tried to say that was adequate and without conflict of interest. Can anyone really believe that Republicans wouldn't be calling her a corrupt traitor? Republicans said \"Lock Her Up\" over emails that did absolutely nothing and were of no real value because, realistically, they would have been leaked by either the Republicans or Comey's FBI NY office. But if the hacking of Democrats and a few Republicans by Russians is no big deal to Republicans, why did they get so upset over an email server in Clinton's home in the first place? This is the definition of hypocrisy isn't it. Comey talking about emails again right before the election while knowing this stuff about Trump and Co. and the Russian hacking was out there but remained silent. The sad fact here is that there is a code of ethics for everyone but Republicans and Trump in particular. People may forget he is the first Presidential candidate of any party since Nixon not to release their tax return. He says he is still under audit - I say he is lying to the American people. If he had nothing to hide he could increase his credibility just by doing so. The lack of transparency is a de facto admission of guilt and the only question is, of what?

But you left out two points of crucial  importance. First, the most explosive charge comes today from the British newspaper, The Independent. They claim that Christopher Steele concluded that there was a cabal within the FBI that was intentionally blocking investigation of Trump's collusion with Russia, insisting instead on investigating Hillary's emails. The Independent claims that Steele was so alarmed by this that after the election he was working for free, desperately trying to alert the other intelligence agencies to the danger. Needless to say, this is deeply disturbing, suggesting as it does institutional corruption going even beyond Trump.<br/><br/>Second, as for the dossier, it is not quite right to assert that there is \"zero public evidence behind it.\" As the Guardian has pointed out, the report is written chronologically and makes a number of substantive predictions that turn out to be correct. For example, it warns about Carter Page's involvement with the Russians, an issue that became known publicly only several months later. (Note that Trump at his most recent press conference denied even knowing Page, one of his senior advisers on Russia. Why?) More importantly the dossier correctly predicted that Trump would favor giving Putin a pass on Crimea and urge a critical attitude toward NATO--all before he made any public pronouncements on these issues.

That's crazy talk.  Democrats consistently beat Republicans in fact checking.  It's only the twisting of those facts by people like you who have made Americans believe that the falsehood that Democrats are credible.  Are you regretting that yet?

Poor before, poor now. Alabama as a state has many advantages, good government and good public officials are, however, non existent. A huge defense operation on the old Brookley Field site in Mobile pulls in big contracts, but the region is as poor as it ever was. <br/><br/>One sign, the taxes are all skewed to hit the lower income. Near that Mobile site, sales taxes are 10 percent, tax rate for low income is the same as those at the absolute top. <br/><br/>Create housing by filling in the Bay or the water around Manhattan?<br/><br/>It would appear the biggest problem in San Francisco is the commuters from Silicon Valley with real money, who want to living. FWIW, looking around the country, the Bay area and the NYC metropolitan area are doing very well.<br/><br/>They\u2019re being tapped along with other Northeast Corridor taxpayers and other developed states for tax money to keep the Red States solvent.

Russia can invade sovereign nations at will ignoring international law because Exxon Mobil needs to provide profits for its shareholders?. Talk about prostituting our value of standing up to dictators and the rule of international law. PEOTUS Trump already says if they are helping us why should there be sanctions?
