When you think of a college institution as a kind of company or industry (you pay money, tuition; they offer a service, education), then it makes sense. Every employee handbook that I've read has a section asserting that disrespect, harassment or discrimination in the workplace can lead to termination and/or severe consequences. The same goes for colleges and universities. Harassment and discrimination (which makes up the foundation of Title IX) should lead to some form of review process to see whether or not the respondent (\"accused,\" if you will) deserves to stay in that particular institution.<br/> Subsequently, if the reporting party chooses to press criminal charges before, during or after the review process at the university, then they can do that as well. Sexual assault can result in trauma, fear and even feelings of humiliation and isolation that make it difficult to process the incident. Thus, they might avoid calling local police.<br/>For this reason, I don't see the university system as a replacement of the justice system at all. I see it as a process, one that is adopted by most American institutions anyways, to review the incident and make a decision based on the evidence provided. Essentially, it serves to determine whether or not an individual violated the \"company rules\" and what sanctions should be given out, whether that means remedial therapy, suspension or expulsion.

Generally the campus police is called first at those locations if the incident is reported immediately.
