If someone else had been following \"@POTUS\" during the Obama Administration, he will now find himself following \"@POTUS44\" (one of Barack Obama's newly-assigned Twitter accounts); but he will still be following \"@POTUS\", which will no longer transmit Obama Tweets.

If I worked at the Broughton plant you're referring to, I'd be very nervous about my prospects! Airbus has no real reason to keep making A380 wings there, if at all. On the contrary, there's probably significant political pressure on the Airbus brass to *stop* manufacturing parts in the UK and bring the jobs back to EU countries.<br/><br/>Also, contrary to populist rhetoric, immigrants aren't sitting around in the south-east of England twiddling their thumbs and consuming services. They're there because there is lots of work and not enough English people to do it. They're mostly working and paying taxes. (In stark contrast to the hundreds of thousands of retired British seeking warmer climes in Spain and France. A great illustration of this is the *fact* that in 2014/15 the UK paid \u00a3700m to cover British expat healthcare and only received \u00a350m back.) The uncomfortable truth is most immigrants will likely be asked to stay, because the UK needs them!
