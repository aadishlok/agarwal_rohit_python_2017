Equality is glorified in the form of Socialism. Of course, as we all know the only difference between Socialism and Communism is elections, one has the pretense of democracy, the other simply does away with it as it's no longer necessary when everyone depends on the state for livelihood. <br/><br/>Judging from the reaction of the butt hurt generation on the result of this election, I'd say our Indoctrination I mean Education System has been doing such a fine job with the brainwashing of our youth the past 4 decades there is no longer a need for Socialism, we are ready to go straight to Communism. Why bother with elections when only one outcome is acceptable?", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "createDate": "1483118622", "updateDate": "1483335999", "approveDate": "1483335999", "userID": 58463257, "userDisplayName": "Beth", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "WA", "editorsSelection": 0, "recommendationCount": 0, "replyCount": 0, "assetID": 3463644, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/asia/shanghai-schools-international-curriculum.html", "status": "approved", "commentType": "userReply", "replies": []}, {"commentID": 20949487, "parentID": null, "statusID": 2, "lft": 36, "rgt": 37, "commentSequence": 20949487, "commentBody": "I don't believe that the conflict is between Western and Chinese values.
