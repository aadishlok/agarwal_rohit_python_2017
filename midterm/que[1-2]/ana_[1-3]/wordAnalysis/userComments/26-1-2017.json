Many of them live with relatives in places like Salinas. the bus picks them up, takes them to the fields, the get paid by the amount they harvest, the contractor collects from the farmer, he pays the workers. Without these workers the east coast would not get many products from the fields. They have to work hard and fast to make enough to pay rent and send some home. <br/><br/>We see comment here all the time as to how Americans would do the jobs if paid better, showing ignorance of the work and travel required. When one crop is harvested, they have to move on to another, strawberries and apples ripen at different times and in different places, as do the truck crops in Imperial county. My gardener had five crews until a couple of years ago but the undocumented ones left. They spent, bought pickups, groceries, clothing, electronics, all contributing to the economy. My uncle had an apricot farm, he had to tear out the trees when he could not pickers any more. <br/><br/>A lot of those affordable tract homes were built by them, that was what made them affordable.

Eight and then four years ago Mitt Romney often talked about the need for a fence to finally control our southern border. Congress even passed the Secure Fence Act of 2008 which was supposed to finally secure our border. It was partly built (and of course partly doesn't help). <br/><br/>But now somehow when Donald Trump does get serious about building a wall that is terribly offensive to the Mexican people? <br/><br/>I can understand how this puts Enrique Pena Nieto in a bind, and wish there were some way to soften the blow. And Donald Trump should not keep saying that Mexico is going to pay for the wall -- of course they are not and that's a low blow that helps no one. <br/><br/>But I cannot see why the Democrats in the United States think that we should allow people and goods to illegally cross our southern border, and that people who are in our country illegally should be allowed to stay. I applaud Donald Trump's actions. <br/><br/>And I hope that Enrique Pena Nieto does show up. I think a dialogue between the two men will help a lot. Donald Trump tweets like a tiger and signs documents that are harsh. But in person he is more of a pussycat. (As Mitt Romney found out.)
