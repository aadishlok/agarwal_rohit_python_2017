Many people would not purchase insurance if they were not required to, thus decreasing the number of people in the insurance \"pool\".  They would be comfortable doing so because they would know that if and when they ever did need insurance, they could just purchase it at that time, but that means they would have contributed nothing until that time, putting more of a burden on everyone else.  The second problem is that such a proposal does nothing for those who who can't afford to purchase whatever insurance is available.    And would a requirement like this take care of the problem of pre-existing conditions or of lifetime limits on care, etc.   As Trump may eventually figure out, it's not as simple as he likes to claim it is when he's making his absurd statements.
