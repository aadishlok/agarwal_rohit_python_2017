How can it be said that a tariff on imports is paid by the exporter?  As I understand the model, the exporter in another country enters into a contract to sell goods to the importer in the U.S.  The price of the goods is at the factory door.  Shipping and customs clearance are the responsibility of the importer.  The customs agent looks at the goods and the documentation and determines the price is X and the duty is 20%, payable by the importer.  The importer then the price of the goods in the domestic market at cost of the goods (X) + duty (0.2X) + shipping + local costs + profit.<br/><br/>Everything beyond X is the responsibility of the importer, not the exporter.

Couple that with Hispanic illegal immigration and suddenly lily white America is no more. That is the problem here and, in Britain.
