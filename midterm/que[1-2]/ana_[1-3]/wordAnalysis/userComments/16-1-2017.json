He also introduced me to the language of the kitchen and it was from him I learned what folding meant when mixing ingredients.  He also introduced me to \"exotic\" things like red bell peppers lol and oyster sauce as well as the wonders of fresh herbs and freshly ground spices.  Thanks to Mr. Kerr's guidance I discovered a real love for cooking and feeding the people I love and I ultimately ended up going to Culinary School.  Thank you Chef Kerr for all your wonderful programs and especially for introducing me to the MiniMax way of cooking when I was making my first tentative forays into the world of food.

Look at the example in the photograph where restaurant wait-staff are being replaced by tablets and self-service.  A lot of automation transfers work that used to be performed by employees onto customers. Online travel companies like Travelocity reduce the need for travel agents. These developments often provide customers with benefits like the ability to shop for airfares and hotel accommodations from a broad array of choices.

Deficit spending when unemployment is high can create jobs when the private sector was not willing to do so; doing so when unemployment is low won't create jobs, it simply competes with the jobs that the private sector is creating.  Deficit spending even in low unemployment can still be a good idea, i.e. when private sector corporations won't improve our public infrastructure out of the goodness of their hearts, and when borrowing for infrastructure spending is still cheap due to low interest rates.
