No need to argue over interpretation, he's trying to deceive you into thinking we have full employment. This is refuted by actual data. While a majority of 125 million voters agreed with this deception, American economy is great, an all important 50,000 in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania seemed to have a firmer grip on reality. Again, looking at actual data, not only were quit rates pre recession pretty underwhelming (see the other link I'm providing), but the Chart 5 from first link shows the same number of hires and quits ten years later, as if the the economy had not grown at all. Openings are up considerably because employers won't raise wages and have learned just to keep an elevated level of openings. Otherwise you would see more hires. There is no skills shortage.  Real wages (nominal minus inflation) are barely up 1%, the gains skewed to upper incomes, aided by oil price induced low inflation still rippling through economy, and DNWR which coasts well above 0% for most workers. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/web/jolts/jlt_labstatgraphs.pdf\" title=\"https://www.bls.gov/web/jolts/jlt_labstatgraphs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.bls.gov/web/jolts/jlt_labstatgraphs.pdf</a><br/><a href=\"http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/we-need-more-quitters\" title=\"http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/we-need-more-quitters\" target=\"_blank\">http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/we-need-more-quitters</a><br/><br/>We are five years away from full employment, at least.", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "createDate": "1483947946", "updateDate": "1483947966", "approveDate": "1483947966", "userID": 49343485, "userDisplayName": "C", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "New York, N.Y.", "editorsSelection": 0, "recommendationCount": 5, "replyCount": 1, "assetID": 3464011, "assetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/the-shock-of-the-normal/", "status": "approved", "commentType": "comment", "replies": {"comments": [{"commentID": 21043140, "status": "approved", "commentSequence": 21043140, "userID": 66568899, "userDisplayName": "Spengler", "userLocation": "Ohio", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "I can't believe people \"rec'd\" this.
