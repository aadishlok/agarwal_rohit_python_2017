In effect they elected Trump as much as white women did.  It is not surprising the overwhelming black vote Hillary got- she constantly pandered to blacks while excluded 87% of America.  She trotted around with Michael Brown's mother and a dozen other black women who'd lost children to gun violence by whites.  2% of all violence in white on black.  70% of all interracial violence has a black perpetrator.  But she chose to exclude the mother's who were not black and whose killer wasn't white.  Not one of these deaths were any more tragic then gun violence that happens everyday, and in several cases (such as Brown) the culpability rests solely with the criminal actions of the deceased person.  Why does the mother of a black male who robbed then brutually assaulted an elderly Asian clerk then tried to kill a cop get put on a pedestal?  It's offensive and racist.  If Brown were Asian and that store clerk a Somalian immigrant his mom would not be touted by the Democrats.<br/>Blacks seem to think the fact that most blacks voted for Hillary means they used better judgement.
