Yes, transportation emissions are a contributor to climate change, but livestock and its byproducts are responsible for 32 million tons of CO2 each year (51% of all greenhouse gas emissions).  <br/><br/>Methane (the greenhouse gas resulting from animal agriculture) is 25-100 times more destructive than CO2, and has a much higher potential for global warming.  <br/><br/>Animal agriculture is responsible for 80-90% of water consumption:<br/>2,500 gallons per 1lb of beef<br/>1,000 gallons per 1 gallon of milk<br/>900 gallons per 1 lb of cheese<br/><br/>Internationally, cows drink 45 billion gallons of water and eat 135 billion lbs of grain each day. We currently grow enough food to feed 10 billion people, but at least 50% of that supply is fed to the livestock. About 82% of starving children live in countries where the food is fed to animals and the animals are eaten by western nations. Starving children exactly like Tsapasoa and Fombasoa. <br/><br/>Reducing consumption of animal products will eventually decrease the impact of the animal agriculture industry. This change is urgent as the animal agriculture industry affects everything and everyone on this planet. Instead of lamenting the condition of the environment through social media posts and shares, please consider how you personally can create change through your actions. Perhaps along the way, compassion for animals will also find a place. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/\" title=\"http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/</a>", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "createDate": "1483852287", "updateDate": "1483852327", "approveDate": "1483852327", "userID": 78466792, "userDisplayName": "RES", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Baltimore", "editorsSelection": 0, "recommendationCount": 11, "replyCount": 8, "assetID": 3463989, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/opinion/sunday/as-donald-trump-denies-climate-change-these-kids-die-of-it.html", "status": "approved", "commentType": "comment", "replies": {"comments": [{"commentID": 21029419, "status": "approved", "commentSequence": 21029419, "userID": 7506167, "userDisplayName": "Rachel", "userLocation": "Los Alamos", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "commentBody": "The numbers in your first paragraph are completely wrong.
