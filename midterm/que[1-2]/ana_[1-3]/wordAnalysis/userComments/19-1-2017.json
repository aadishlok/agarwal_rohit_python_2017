This is critical to ensure that people don't commit suicides by resorting to blowing themselves apart with guns or by hanging or jumping off a high rise. The world should not be so cruel as to not understand the pain and suffering of another person and to not let that person end their own suffering in a humane manner. Jack Kervokian was a thinker ahead of his time and unless there has been some innovative painless way to end lives for those who are suffering extremely, then the Kevorkian suicide machine should be the accepted device that can be used and special places can be designated to conduct physician supervised and assisted suicide, with a coroner as a witness and a religious representative at their side if the person ending his or her life chooses. There are roughly 40,000 suicides occurring every year and that number will not change, but what can change is that they will die with dignity, compassion and acceptance by family and friends.
