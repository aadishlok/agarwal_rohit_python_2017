One pool consists of analysts and designers who identify and clarify challenges, create response strategies and systems to address those, and relate behavior to performance. The second pool are the operators whose attention to day-to-day matters help to assure agencies function effectively yet have the stand-by capabilities to ramp up when needed. Most of the Center for Disease Control operations are routine although highly technical but it needs the capability to address unknown diseases during an epidemic. What keeps these capacities efficient are the middle managers constantly confronting the balance between the routine and the exceptional, the familiar and the new. Donald Trump has some familiarity with the operational needs of the real estate and entertainment industries but how well does he understand the relationship between direct service clinical personnel in the V.A. and the management of outreach services vs. records control? How will a hiring freeze affect departmental IT units compared to public information services? What Trump seems to want is a reduction in service effectiveness so there are fewer audits of high net worth individuals or inspectors to make sure fecal matter is not included in ground meat at your supermarket.

Forty years ago, faculty were still being hired with a well-placed phone call from their graduate advisors, and completion of the dissertation was the sole expectation. Today (in a field like literature) roughly one-quarter of recently minted Ph.D.s will actually land full-time, tenure track positons, and will have published half a dozen articles and maybe a book or two before being hired. The rest will either find work outside of academics, or barely sustain themselves in a life of piecing together adjunct teaching jobs. You're correct that many universities who never place their students in jobs do exploit them for their cheap labor. But the sad fact is that in most fields, less than a dozen programs produce 90% of the hires, and those programs are every bit as rigorous than leading programs forty years ago, with the added element of dramatically higher levels of competition. Sadly, a consequence of this hyper-competition is the felt need to give catchy titles to conference papers, but to imagine this is a sign of decreased rigor suggests you may be fairly removed from what goes on in higher education today.", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "createDate": "1483423471", "updateDate": "1483423507", "approveDate": "1483423507", "userID": 73741891, "userDisplayName": "CraiginKC", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "userLocation": "Kansas City, MO", "editorsSelection": 0, "recommendationCount": 5, "replyCount": 0, "assetID": 3463634, "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/upshot/fake-academe-looking-much-like-the-real-thing.html", "status": "approved", "commentType": "userReply", "replies": []}, {"commentID": 20969634, "parentID": null, "statusID": 2, "lft": 38, "rgt": 41, "commentSequence": 20969634, "commentBody": "Mongolia is a landlocked country stuck between Russia and China, and<br/>was a part of China until WWII, under an accord between USSR and Nationalist government, a continuation of over 100 years of history of<br/>China losing territory as well as sovereignty to western powers starting<br/>with the Opium War, even though China was supported to be on the<br/>winning side of the war.

The right wing populism of the Tea Party has moved into the person of Donald Trump who will take office as a compromised man , low approval ratings, supported by a foreign power, and voted against by a numerical majority of Americans. A ludicrous figure who stoked the worst passions, temperamentally unfit and a needy narcissist. It's time for those opposed to this mess  to learn something from Republicans now.

The remaining 90 percent must make their way in industry, an area where supervisor's lack of expertise is magnitudes higher. The potential for new hires to skate by with impressive sounding credentials, or for those seeking promotion or junkets based on easy-to-attend conferences is that much easier. This was under-reported in the article and magnified by so many professors saying \"not at my school\" with indignant tones.<br/><br/>Academic ivory towers benefit by skimming the creamiest of the crop, but they are also the most well-positioned authorities to become arbiters of which journals and conferences are legitimate. Without their exercise of this responsibility, entire disciplines risk becoming marginalized. The result that science is accused of being nothing more than another lobby, seeking its place at the trough--where there is no truth, just special interests--is not shocking.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that many of the tenured select say it's not a problem for real institutions or legitimate professors!
