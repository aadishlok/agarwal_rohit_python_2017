Google \"DXY chart\" for a graph of Dollar Index Futures to see this. <br/><br/>Trump's policy of reducing China's bilateral trade surplus with the US is most definitely a strong dollar policy. If a country runs a trade deficit, it must issue additional currency to pay for foreign goods. Dumping more currency in the markets, weakens one's own currency. Basic supply and demand.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if Trump could (?) bring more manufacturing back to the US  that would, in fact, slow the rise of China relative to the US. Since China exports $20-30 billion more to the US than we sell to China, China will be the big overall loser in a trade war with the United States, even if some companies would of course lose out. <br/><br/>Finally, TPP has absolutely nothing to do with China's rise. China is rising because America handed over to China its best technology, and because America finances China's rise by allowing China to run a trade surplus against the US. China has also used the money we have given them to buy up key natural resources in Africa and buy influence in our South American backyard. TPP is irrelevant to all this. <br/><br/>Note well: we kept the Soviets out of Latin America (ex Cuba) and kept our technology away from them. Those are big reasons why the US won the Cold War. By doing the opposite, we are losing to China now.
